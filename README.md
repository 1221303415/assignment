# Alien vs. Zombie

## Compilation Instructions
Provide instructions on how to compile your program, especially when it is non-trivial.

For example:

"g++ main.cpp"

```
g++ main.cpp folder1\code.cpp folder2\code.cpp ......
```

## User Manual

Please provide the user manual on how to use your program.

1. Once compiled, there will be a main menu. Users may enter a number that corresponds to their decision.
2. When users enter "1" at the main menu, they will be redirected to the actual game board. Once there, users may input "help" in order to view the game controls. Unfortunately, the game has not been completed, so users are not able to play it at the moment. However, they may still experience the robustness of quality and effort that has been put into the making of the code.
3. When users input "2" at the main menu, they are redirected to the same page as before, only this time, it is loaded instead of a new game.
4. When users input "3" at the main menu, they are redirected to the Game Settings page where they can change the game settings of the game. Instructions are given in the actual game.
5. To exit the game, users may input "4" at the main menu which then shows a thank you message as well as turning off the game properly.
