## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. As a group, we couldn't find a way to insert the game objects and zombies without affecting the Alien in the center. In the end, we've decided that since we were running out of time, we should just go with the option that is possible to get us the highest amount of marks, which was to only go with the Alien on the center of the board.
2. We couldn't find a way to save or load the game file without corrupting the code. Instead, we decided to do easier tasks first.
3. As for the rest of the minimum requirements, unfortunately we did not have enough time to do so, resulting in only about 50 percent of the game completed.
